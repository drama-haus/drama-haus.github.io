## Quick start

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull # make sure you have the latest changes
git checkout -b my-world # create a new branch for your world
npx hypkg apply drama-haus/ide-scripting
npm install # install the file watcher
```

## Features

- **Live IDE Sync**: Modify script files in your external IDE, and the `AssetWatcher` system automatically detects changes, updates the relevant blueprint, and rebuilds the app in real-time.
- **In-World Script Renaming**: Easily rename scripts through the "Script" pane UI, with changes seamlessly propagating through the system.

## How it works

The `AssetWatcher` system monitors the `scripts` folder for changes. When a change is detected, it updates the relevant blueprint and rebuilds the app.

<Aside type="note">
When importing apps made with this mod to vanilla worlds, you need to save the script once after importing for it to work properly.
